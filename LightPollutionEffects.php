					<h2>EFFECTS</h2>
					<p> <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/antoncivicissues/category/light-pollution/" target="_blank" style = "color: #4CD7F32">Many animals are affected by light pollution</a>
						because light and dark signals when to feed, sleep, hunt, migrate, or reproduce. As a result, light pollution alters and disrupts the timing of essential biological activities. Artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks, which has a negative impact on plant reproduction. In one study, nocturnal visits to plants were decreased by 62 percent when artificially illuminated plantâ€“pollinator populations were compared to dark areas. </p>
					<p> Could light pollution be a factor in coral reef deterioration?<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/07/science/light-pollution-effects-environment.html" target="_blank" style = "color: #4CD7F32"> By moonlight, more than 130 separate coral species on the Great Barrier Reef spawn new life. </a> 
						The reefs spew sperm and eggs into the ocean in what looks like an underwater blizzard every October or November after the full moon. Fertilization starts when the two sex cells merge amid the flurry. According to Oren Levy of Bar-Ilan University in Israel, bright city lights will obscure the moon's phases, throwing the corals' biological clocks out of whack. Reefs can release their reproductive cells late or not at all as a result of this, reducing their chances of producing offspring.</p>
					<p> Since most songbirds migrate at night, light pollution may throw off their circadian rhythms and cause them to become disoriented throughout migration. Large buildings with bright lights at night attract birds in the same way as bright porch lights attract moths, resulting in fatal collisions. </p>

								the hatchlings migrate away from the dark silhouettes of the sand dunes and toward the lighter horizon of the ocean. However, as many coastal areas become more populated, artificial lights attract baby sea turtles away from the protection of the ocean and towards shore, where they risk dehydration, encountering predators, or being hit by vehicles. Any reduction in artificial lighting near beaches will aid in the protection of newly hatched sea turtles. </p>

					<p> Plants' life cycles are often affected by light pollution, which can prevent them from flowering and reproducing. This has an effect on the pollinators that pollinate these plants, as well as their own life cycles. Humans are also affected. One-third of human food needs pollination, according to the

					<p> <a href="https://cescos.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-Amphib.html" target="_blank" style = "color: #4CD7F32">Amphibians are an important component </a>
						of forest and aquatic ecosystems, and their sensitivity to environmental changes makes them an important indicator species for ecosystem health. However, environmental stresses have caused their populations to decline around the world, and light pollution may play a significant role in this decline by altering nocturnal amphibians' foraging and breeding habits. </p>
					<p> Humans are also affected by light pollution. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/nocturnal_earthnight.htm" target="_blank" style = "color: #4CD7F32">Humans, too, need natural darkness </a>
						to get a good night's sleep and stay healthy. By suppressing melatonin and can cortisol, a brain chemical produced when we are activated or excited, cool blue white light from sources such as LEDs, fluorescent, and metal halide lights interferes with the body's circadian rhythms at night. High cortisol levels make falling asleep and getting deep sleep difficult, which our immune systems need to combat illness and disease. </p>
